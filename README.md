Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most important, least explored, and most sought-after areas of data science in the labor market. OFFCORSS, the a leading company in the clothing market for the segment of children in Colombia is committed to become a data driven company through digital transformation and new technologies related to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The company has detected an opportunity in the understanding of its customers and what they think of its products and services. Due to the huge amount of impact that communication between companies and customers have nowadays through social networks and other communication channels like comments on the webpage, emails from customers and so on, is evident that we have an important and wide corpus of information that can and should be systematically stored, analysed and measured in order to get a better understanding of customer sentiment (like satisfaction, expectations among others) about the company's products. This project has the intent to carry on this process with the help of AI technologies like NLP, expecting that with this information OFFCORSS will have an opportunity to make valuable decisions to improve their assertiveness in the proposal of fashion, materials, customer service tracking, among others.

The three main competitors are Baby Fresh, EPK and Polito. Therefore, our main focus would be on these 4 companies. Our objectives would be:
- Collect data from the main social networks. Comments, answers, emotions, number of times it was shared, among others.
- To transform the collected data into information to help in the decision making process.
- Automate the processes of data collection and information processing
